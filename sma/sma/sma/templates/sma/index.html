            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>
                Recent scientific and medical advances have led to substantial
                changes in the treatment of many neuromuscular diseases (NMD).
                New therapeutic strategies are being developed and, for some of
                these treatments, plans for large studies involving patients
                from more than one country are already in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Australian Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Registry
                has been developed to collate a patient's SMA gene sequence and
                clinical information about their disease. The Registry provides an
                important enabling tool for clinicians and clinical trial sponsors
                to quickly identify patients suitable for each study, particularly
                those therapeutic strategies that target specific genetic defects.
                Potentially eligible patients will be informed about new trials and
                studies through the Registry's clinical network.

        <div id="purpose">
            <h2>Purpose</h2>

            <p>
                To provide Australian Spinal Muscular Atrophy families with an
                opportunity to improve the outcomes of individuals affected by SMA.

            <h2>Objectives</h2>

            <p>
                To improve care of SMA patients through the coordination of
                diagnosis and therapy and by ensuring new intervention strategies
                are available on an equitable and consistent manner across Australia; and
            </p>
            <p>
                To improve opportunities for international collaboration by
                facilitating and accelerating recruitment process of Australian SMA
                patients into new clinical trials and for participating in studies
                for the benefit of the world SMA community and the advancement of medical science.
