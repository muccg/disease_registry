                    <p>
                        Recent scientific and medical advances have led to substantial
                        changes in the treatment of many neuromuscular diseases (NMD).
                        New therapeutic strategies are being developed and, for some of
                        these treatments, plans for large studies involving patients
                        from more than one country are already in place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Australian Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1) Registry
                        has been developed to collate a patient's DM1 gene sequence and
                        clinical information about their disease. The Registry provides an
                        important enabling tool for clinicians and clinical trial sponsors
                        to quickly identify patients suitable for each study, particularly
                        those therapeutic strategies that target specific genetic defects.
                        Potentially eligible patients will be informed about new trials and
                        studies through the Registry's clinical network.

                    <p>
                        To provide Australian Myotonic Dystrophy families with an
                        opportunity to improve the outcomes of individuals affected by DM1.

                    <p>
                        To improve care of DM1 patients through the coordination of
                        diagnosis and therapy and by ensuring new intervention strategies
                        are available on an equitable and consistent manner across Australia; and
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To improve opportunities for international collaboration by
                        facilitating and accelerating recruitment process of Australian DM1
                        patients into new clinical trials and for participating in studies
                        for the benefit of the world DM1 community and the advancement of medical science.
